# Headline Variation Ops (2026-02-18)

This file defines anti-homogeneous headline rules.  
Execution pack: `evidence/headline/headline-variation-pack-20260218.md`

## Required Components

- Scenario: who is in which constraint and stage
- Result: what outcome is achievable/avoidable
- Time or Cost anchor: weeks, budget, number of steps, threshold

## Required 5-Angle Set (per article)

- `conflict_title`: 冲突型（指出常见误判）
- `risk_stoploss_title`: 止损型（先说代价，再给止损动作）
- `numeric_title`: 数字型（金额/周数/步骤）
- `counterintuitive_title`: 反常识型（逆预期结论 + 证据边界）
- `scenario_result_timeline_title`: 场景结果型（人群+阶段+时间内可达结果）

## Hard Constraints

- Five titles must be all different in wording and angle.
- `conflict_title` cannot be identical to `risk_stoploss_title`.
- `numeric_title` cannot be identical to `scenario_result_timeline_title`.
- Weekly test set must include at least 2 highly distinguishable variants per topic.

## Anti-Template Rules

- Do not repeat identical opening structures across consecutive posts.
- Avoid generic labels such as "X怎么选" without audience and consequence.
- At least 50% weekly titles must include explicit quant anchors.
- At least 30% weekly titles must use counterintuitive framing with evidence boundary.

## Review Checklist

- Can target users identify "this is for me" in 3 seconds?
- Is gain/loss explicit?
- Is this variant visibly different from other four variants?
- Does this title map to concrete body structure and CTA asset?
