## Retrieval Notes

- Zhihu/Xiaohongshu totals still require logged-in browser capture and anti-bot signature compatibility.
- For policy conclusions, P0 pages above are already sufficient and should not be replaced by secondary sources.
- If admission windows are blocked in terminal, collect browser screenshot with timestamp and store under `evidence/sources/`.
