## P2 Demand Signal Rule

- Zhihu/Xiaohongshu/Google Trends can set topic priority, but cannot support policy conclusion.
- If anti-bot/login blocks data capture, keep field as owner-fill and attach capture SOP + screenshot timestamp.

## Change Control

- If any P0 item changes, patch all related article data points and lead magnet claims on the same day.
- No policy number may appear in article text unless it can be mapped back to this file line-by-line.
