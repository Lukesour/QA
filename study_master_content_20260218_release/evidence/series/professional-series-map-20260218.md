## Publishing Rule

- Every weekly country article must include one professional CTA hook.
- Each article should expose at least one "职业岗位词" in title/body/CTA.
- For Zhihu, prioritize Q&A framing; for Xiaohongshu, prioritize checklist + case framing.

## KPI Extension

- Add dimension: `professional_track` with values `business|cs_data|media`.
- Weekly compare by track on `read_completion_rate`, `dm_rate`, `consult_book_rate`.
- Trigger rework if a track stays below country-stage baseline for 2 consecutive weeks.
