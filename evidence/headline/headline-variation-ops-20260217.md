# Headline Variation Ops (2026-02-17)

This file is the operating guideline for anti-homogeneous titles.
Full article-level variants are stored in `v1_2_content_system.headline_variation_registry`.

## Required Components

- Scenario: who is in what constraint
- Result: what outcome is achievable or avoidable
- Time or Cost: timeline, budget, or quantified action

## Anti-Template Rules

- Do not use identical opening patterns in consecutive posts.
- Avoid pure topic labels such as "X怎么选" without audience or consequence.
- At least one quantifier in title (weeks, budget, steps, ratio, deadline).

## Three Working Formulas

1. Scenario conflict + result gap + deadline
2. Budget constraint + decision action + executable output
3. Failure cost + stop-loss action + target persona

## Fast Review Checklist

- Can audience recognize "this is for me" in 3 seconds?
- Is the value explicit (gain or loss avoided)?
- Is this title visibly different from this week's previous title?
