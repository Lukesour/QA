# Headline Variation Ops (2026-02-18)

This file is the operating guideline for anti-homogeneous titles.

## Required Components

- Scenario: who is in what constraint
- Result: what outcome is achievable or avoidable
- Time or Cost: timeline, budget, step count, or threshold

## Required 4D Variation Set (per article)

- conflict_title: 冲突型（直接指出常见误判）
- risk_stoploss_title: 止损型（先说失败代价，再给止损动作）
- numeric_title: 数字型（金额/周数/步骤数）
- counterintuitive_title: 反常识型（先给逆预期结论，再给证据）

## Current Production Bank

- Primary file: `evidence/headline/headline-4d-variants-20260218.md`
- Rule: for each article, publish 2 of the 4 variants and keep 2 as A/B reserve.

## Anti-Template Rules

- Do not use identical opening patterns in consecutive posts.
- Avoid pure topic labels such as "X怎么选" without audience or consequence.
- At least 50% of weekly titles must include explicit quantifier anchors (time/cost/steps).
- At least 30% of weekly titles must use counterintuitive framing with evidence anchors.

## Working Formulas

1. Scenario conflict + result gap + deadline
2. Budget constraint + decision action + executable output
3. Failure cost + stop-loss action + target persona
4. Counterintuitive claim + evidence reversal + audience boundary

## Fast Review Checklist

- Can audience recognize "this is for me" in 3 seconds?
- Is the value explicit (gain or loss avoided)?
- Is this title visibly different from this week's previous title?
- Does this title map to at least one concrete CTA asset?
- Does this title avoid direct duplication with other 3 variants of the same article?
