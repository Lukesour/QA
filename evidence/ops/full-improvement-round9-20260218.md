4. Updated case proof index and manual-fill board to reflect “offers bound, screenshot pending” state.
5. Prepared round-9 source registration updates in `material.json`.

## Still Manual Fill

1. Case screenshot bundles and desensitization notes for all 30 articles.
2. Login-only SEO totals (Zhihu/Xiaohongshu) and Google Trends numeric captures.
3. Private conversion system IDs and production webhook domain.

## Publish Rule

- Even with offers-case binding completed, publish state remains `needs_case_upload` until screenshot evidence is uploaded and verified.
