# Current Content Gap Analysis (2026-02-18)

## Priority Fixes (From High to Low)

1. Upload real case proof bundles for the next publishing batch first.
- Why: credibility and conversion drop fastest when article claims are not backed by visible case evidence.
  - Progress: A01-A30 have been bound to real admissions from `offers.jsonl` in `evidence/case-proofs/offers-case-binding-20260218.md`; remaining blocker is screenshot/desensitization upload.

2. Fill logged-in SEO totals for all 30 keywords.
- Why: without stable demand and competition signals, scheduling priority is still partially blind.

3. Complete private conversion IDs and webhook domain.
- Why: without end-to-end tracking IDs, articles cannot be attributed to consultations and deals.

4. Keep monthly policy revalidation cadence with explicit date labels in published content.
- Why: visa/work policy is high-volatility; visible verification date reduces audience trust risk.

## Recommended Information Sources

### A-level (must-use, primary sources)
- UK GOV: student visa money, visa fees table, IHS.
- HK Immigration Department: study visa, IANG, fees under specified schemes, annual report chapter.
- Singapore MOM/ICA: EP eligibility, foreign student work exemption, Student's Pass collect fees.
- Study Australia / Home Affairs pages: subclass 500 fee and in-term work-right summary.

### B-level (application execution)
- University official admissions pages (NUS/NTU/SMU/HKU/HKBU/EdUHK/Exeter/Glasgow/Unimelb).
- Official program deadline and intake pages.

### C-level (content prioritization)
- Zhihu and Xiaohongshu in-app search result pages (logged-in manual capture).
- Google Trends UI screenshots for each core keyword.

### D-level (benchmark only)
- RivalIQ, Socialinsider, Hootsuite, Unbounce.
- Use only for KPI baseline, not for policy conclusions.

## Practical Rule

- If data cannot be reliably captured in terminal/public mode, keep explicit `[待你填写_...]` slots.
- Do not replace missing private data with guessed values.
