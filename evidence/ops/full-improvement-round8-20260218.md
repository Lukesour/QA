# Full Improvement Round 8 (2026-02-18)

## Completed in This Round

1. Revalidated policy checkpoints from official government pages and wrote a new log:
   - `evidence/policy/policy-revalidation-round8-web-20260218.md`
2. Converted hard-coded integration placeholders into explicit owner-fill slots in JSON and ops docs:
   - `[待你填写_HUBSPOT_APP_ID]`
   - `[待你填写_TYPEFORM_FORM_ID]`
   - `[待你填写_CALENDLY_ORGANIZATION_URI]`
   - `https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}/...`
3. Replaced branch-specific internal source links with stable `main` links in `source_registry` and evidence references.
4. Updated conversion and owner taskboard docs to keep manual-fill semantics consistent.
5. Kept publish gate intact (`needs_case_upload`) to avoid fake progress before real case proof upload.

## Still Manual Fill

1. Real case bundle uploads and desensitized proof screenshots for all 30 articles.
2. Zhihu/Xiaohongshu logged-in result totals and Google Trends numeric captures.
3. Actual private conversion credentials and production webhook endpoints.

## Delivery Status

- Content structure: complete for A01-A30 (structured drafts + longform + expansion pack).
- Evidence module density: complete baseline (all articles have multiple source refs and data points).
- Publish readiness: blocked only by owner-private inputs and case proof upload evidence.
