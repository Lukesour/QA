# Full Improvement Round 6 (2026-02-18)

## What Was Improved

1. Policy evidence was revalidated online and documented in:
   - `evidence/policy/policy-revalidation-round6-20260218.md`
2. SEO manual fill workflow was expanded from Top 8 to all A01-A30:
   - `evidence/ops/seo-manual-fill-sheet-20260218.md`
3. Global survey entry was bound to LM009 in `material.json` to standardize mid-funnel conversion.
4. `source_freshness_policy` coverage gaps were closed:
   - Added `SRC-HK-IANG-GUIDEBOOK-2025`
   - Added `SRC-SG-MOE-GES-2025`
5. Added source registry item:
   - `SRC-POLICY-REVALIDATION-ROUND6-2026-02-18`

## Still Owner Fill (Cannot Reliably Capture in Terminal)

1. Zhihu/Xiaohongshu full result totals (login + anti-bot signatures required).
2. Google Trends 90d values for A01-A30 (browser capture required).
3. Real case proof bundle uploads (A01-A30) with timestamps and desensitization.
4. HubSpot / Typeform / Calendly IDs and webhook secrets.

## Publish Gate Reminder

- Current state should remain `needs_case_upload` until case proof is uploaded and verified.
- Do not switch to `ready` for scale publishing before:
  - SEO three metrics are filled for priority set and
  - LM009 routing can be executed end-to-end in private funnel.
