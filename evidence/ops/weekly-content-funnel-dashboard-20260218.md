## Weekly Decision Rules
- Keep: article variants that win for two consecutive weeks on `read completion + DM rate + consult booking`.
- Rework: topics with `read completion` below threshold for two weeks.
- Pause: topics with high reads but weak DM/form performance.
- Scale: topics with stable DM->consult->deal conversion.
